- [ ] Identify unique commits and changes
- [ ] Document what the branch contributes
- [ ] Determine if merge is needed
- [ ] Handle conflicts if any
- [ ] Test merged code

## Merge Strategy
- Use main as base
- Merge branches with valuable changes
- Resolve conflicts by choosing most recent/complete version
- Delete branches after successful merge
- Create comprehensive report
