## 🎯 What Was Fixed

This build addresses **three critical UX issues** reported during testing:

### Issue 1: Repetitive Responses ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Only getting "i'm processing visual information from my camera sensors" no matter what was said.

**Root Cause**: LLM fallback was analyzing the full system prompt (which contains "vision" keywords) instead of just the user input, always triggering vision-related responses.

**Fix Applied**:
- Created `generateFallbackResponse()` method in PersonalityEngine.kt (lines 430-486)
- Analyzes user input and intent type to provide varied contextual responses
- Wrapped LLM generation in try-catch to properly invoke fallback
- Added intent-specific responses:
  - **VISION**: "I'm ready to look around. What would you like me to see?"
  - **EMOTION**: "I can sense the emotional context. How can I help you understand the mood?"
  - **MEMORY**: "I'm checking my memory for relevant information about your request."
  - **DEVICE_CONTROL**: "What would you like me to control?" / "Turning on/off the flashlight"
  - **PREDICTION**: "Let me analyze the patterns to help predict what might happen."
  - **CONVERSATION**: Varied responses including greetings, help text, and general assistance

**Files Changed**:
- `app/src/main/java/com/ailive/personality/PersonalityEngine.kt` (lines 306-311, 430-486)

---

### Issue 2: Microphone Auto-Restart ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Microphone kept turning back on even when toggled off by the user.

**Root Cause**: Auto-restart logic in TTS completion handler and wake word restart function didn't check if microphone was still enabled before restarting.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `if (isMicEnabled)` check in TTS completion handler (MainActivity.kt:365)
- Added `isMicEnabled` check in `restartWakeWordListening()` (MainActivity.kt:428)
- Microphone now respects user toggle state and won't auto-restart when disabled

**Files Changed**:
- `app/src/main/java/com/ailive/MainActivity.kt` (lines 365, 428)

---

### Issue 3: Camera Frozen Frame ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Camera showed last captured frame instead of black screen when turned off.

**Root Cause**: CameraX PreviewView retains the last frame after `stopCamera()` is called.

**Fix Applied**:
- Set `cameraPreview.setBackgroundColor(BLACK)` when camera disabled (MainActivity.kt:510)
- Clear result text fields when camera turned off (lines 515-517)
- Set `cameraPreview.setBackgroundColor(TRANSPARENT)` when camera enabled (line 522)
- Reset result text when camera turned on (line 530)

**Files Changed**:
- `app/src/main/java/com/ailive/MainActivity.kt` (lines 510, 515-517, 522, 530)

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Verify Varied Responses
**Purpose**: Confirm the repetitive response issue is fixed

**Steps**:
1. Launch AILive app
2. Enable microphone (🎤 MIC button should be green)
3. Say "Hey Avery" to activate wake word
4. Test the following commands and note the responses:
   - "Hello" → Should greet you
   - "How are you?" → Should respond about system status
   - "What can you help me with?" → Should list capabilities
   - "What do you see?" → Should give vision-related response
   - "Remember this" → Should give memory-related response
   - "Turn on the flashlight" → Should respond about flashlight control

**Expected Result**: ✅ Each command should get a **different, contextual response** (not the same "processing visual information" message)

**Test Result**: [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

**Notes**:
```

### Test 2: Verify Microphone Toggle Persistence
**Purpose**: Confirm microphone respects off state

**Steps**:
1. Launch AILive app
2. Enable microphone (🎤 MIC button should be green)
3. Say "Hey Avery" and give a command (e.g., "Hello")
4. Wait for TTS response to complete
5. **Immediately tap 🎤 MIC button to turn it OFF** (button should turn red)
6. Wait 5-10 seconds and observe the microphone button
7. Tap the microphone button to turn it back ON
8. Say "Hey Avery" again to verify it's working

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ After step 5, microphone button should **stay RED** (off)
- ✅ Status should show "● MIC OFF"
- ✅ Microphone should **not** auto-restart while button is red
- ✅ After step 7, microphone should work normally again

**Test Result**: [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

**Notes**:
```
(Write your observations here)
```

### Test 3: Verify Camera Black Screen
**Purpose**: Confirm camera shows black screen when off

**Steps**:
1. Launch AILive app
2. Camera should be ON by default (📷 CAM button green, live preview visible)
3. Tap the 📷 CAM button to turn camera OFF
4. Observe the camera preview area
5. Wait 5 seconds and observe (should remain black)
6. Tap the 📷 CAM button to turn camera back ON
7. Observe the camera preview area

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ After step 3, camera preview should show **solid black screen** (not last frame)
- ✅ Status should show "● CAM OFF"
- ✅ Result text should show "Camera off"
- ✅ After step 6, camera preview should show **live video feed** again
- ✅ Status should show "● ANALYZING"

**Test Result**: [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

**Notes**:
```
(Write your observations here)
```

## 🔍 Additional Testing

### Test 4: Personality Engine Integration
**Purpose**: Verify unified intelligence is working

**Commands to Test**:
```
1. "Hello" or "Hi"
   Expected: Greeting response

2. "How are you?" or "What's up?"
   Expected: System status response

3. "What can you help me with?" or "Help"
   Expected: List of capabilities

4. "Turn on the flashlight"
   Expected: Flashlight control response

5. "What do you see?" or "Look around"
   Expected: Vision-related response

6. "Remember this: my favorite color is blue"
   Expected: Memory storage confirmation

7. "Thank you"
   Expected: Acknowledgment response
```

**Test Result**: [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

**Notes**:
```
(Write your observations here)
```

---

### Test 5: Voice Consistency
**Purpose**: Verify unified voice (not 6 different voices)

**Steps**:
1. Test various commands from Test 4
2. Listen carefully to TTS voice for each response
3. Note any variations in pitch, rate, or tone

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ All responses should use the **same voice** (pitch=1.0, rate=1.0)
- ✅ No variations between different types of commands

**Test Result**: [ ] PASS / [ ] FAIL

**Notes**:
```
(Write your observations here)
