## ðŸŽ¯ What Changed

Three critical UX issues have been fixed and are ready for testing:

### 1. âœ… Repetitive Responses Fixed
**Before**: Only got "i'm processing visual information from my camera sensors" for every query
**After**: Varied, contextual responses based on intent (greetings, help, vision, memory, device control, etc.)

**Technical Fix**:
- Created `generateFallbackResponse()` with intent-based responses
- Fixed LLM fallback to analyze user input instead of full prompt
- Added 6 intent types with unique responses

### 2. âœ… Microphone Toggle Fixed
**Before**: Microphone kept auto-restarting even when toggled off
**After**: Microphone respects user toggle state and stays off when disabled

**Technical Fix**:
- Added `isMicEnabled` check before auto-restart in TTS completion handler
- Added `isMicEnabled` check in `restartWakeWordListening()`

### 3. âœ… Camera Black Screen Fixed
**Before**: Camera showed frozen last frame when turned off
**After**: Camera shows solid black screen when disabled

**Technical Fix**:
- Set black background when camera off
- Set transparent background when camera on
- Clear result text appropriately

## ðŸ§ª Quick Test

### Test Varied Responses:
1. Enable mic (ðŸŽ¤ should be green)
2. Say "Hey Avery"
3. Try these commands:
   - "Hello" â†’ Should greet
   - "How are you?" â†’ System status
   - "What can you help with?" â†’ List capabilities
   - "What do you see?" â†’ Vision response
   - "Turn on flashlight" â†’ Device control

**Expected**: Each command gets a **different response**

### Test Microphone Toggle:
1. Enable mic
2. Say "Hey Avery, hello"
3. Wait for response
4. **Turn mic OFF** (button red)
5. Wait 10 seconds
6. **Verify mic stays OFF**

**Expected**: Microphone button **stays red** and doesn't auto-restart

### Test Camera:
1. Camera should be on (ðŸ“· green, live feed)
2. **Turn camera OFF** (tap ðŸ“·)
3. **Verify preview shows BLACK SCREEN** (not frozen frame)
4. Turn camera back ON
5. **Verify preview shows LIVE FEED**

**Expected**: Black screen when off, live feed when on
